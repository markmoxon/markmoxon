## Welcome to my software archaeology repositories

My name is Mark Moxon and I'm a software archaeologist and reverse engineer. I love analysing old code, and my aim is to create the best code disassemblies you have ever seen.

You can find the following fully documented and buildable disassemblies here on GitHub:

* Elite on the following platforms:
  * [BBC Micro (cassette)](https://github.com/markmoxon/elite-source-code-bbc-micro-cassette)
  * [BBC Micro (disc)](https://github.com/markmoxon/elite-source-code-bbc-micro-disc)</a>
  * [Acorn Electron](https://github.com/markmoxon/elite-source-code-acorn-electron)
  * [BBC Micro with 6502 Second Processor](https://github.com/markmoxon/elite-source-code-6502-second-processor)
  * [Commodore 64](https://github.com/markmoxon/elite-source-code-commodore-64)

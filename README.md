## Welcome to my software archaeology repositories

My name is Mark Moxon and I'm a software archaeologist and reverse engineer. I love analysing old code, and my aim is to create the best code disassemblies you have ever seen.

You can find the following disassemblies right here on GitHub:

* Elite
* Aviator
* Revs
* Lander
